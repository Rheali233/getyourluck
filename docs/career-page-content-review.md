## 六、FAQ 内容

### FAQ 1：Holland Code 理论科学性
- **问题**：`How scientifically sound is the Holland Code career theory?`
- **回答**：`The Holland Code (RIASEC model) was developed by psychologist John Holland in the 1950s and is one of the most extensively researched career theories. It's supported by over 60 years of empirical studies showing strong correlations between personality types and career satisfaction. The theory is widely used by career counselors and validated across diverse populations and cultures.`
- **图标**：`🔬`

### FAQ 2：DISC 在工作场所的有效性
- **问题**：`Is DISC assessment scientifically valid for workplace evaluation?`
- **回答**：`DISC is based on William Marston's 1928 research and has been refined through decades of organizational psychology studies. While it's widely used by Fortune 500 companies, critics note it lacks the statistical rigor of "Big Five" personality models. It's most valuable for understanding communication styles and team dynamics rather than predicting job performance.`
- **图标**：`📊`

### FAQ 3：领导力评估准确性
- **问题**：`Can leadership potential really be measured through assessment?`
- **回答**：`Leadership assessment draws from competency-based models developed by organizational psychologists. Research shows certain traits (emotional intelligence, decision-making, communication) correlate with leadership effectiveness. However, situational factors and experience play crucial roles. These assessments identify potential strengths and development areas rather than predicting future success.`
- **图标**：`👑`

### FAQ 4：人格-职业匹配算法准确性
- **问题**：`How accurate are personality-to-career matching algorithms?`
- **回答**：`Career matching research shows moderate correlations (0.3-0.5) between personality traits and job satisfaction. While statistically significant, this means personality explains about 15-25% of career satisfaction variance. Other factors like values, skills, interests, work environment, and life circumstances are equally important in career success.`
- **图标**：`🎯`

### FAQ 5：不同年龄组的职业评估
- **问题**：`Do career assessments work differently for different age groups?`
- **回答**：`Research indicates that career interests tend to stabilize by age 25-30, but can still evolve. Younger individuals may show more variability in results, while mid-career professionals often have clearer patterns. Career assessments for older adults may need to account for accumulated experience, changing priorities, and potential age-related workplace biases.`
