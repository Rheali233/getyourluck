## Why Names Matter in Numerology

In numerology, letters are numbers in disguise. A name is understood as a repeating vibration—one that shapes social perception, decision style, and long‑term patterns. While your date of birth describes core essence, your name reflects how that essence meets the world.

### Two Practical Questions
- What number does my current name express?
- Does it harmonize with my life path and current cycle?

## How to Calculate Your Name Number

We use the Pythagorean chart (A=1 … I=9, J=1 … R=9, S=1 … Z=8). Sum the values of all letters in your full name as you use it publicly. Reduce to a single digit by adding the digits repeatedly (keep 11 and 22 as master numbers).

### Example
- Name: ALEX
- A(1)+L(3)+E(5)+X(6) = 15 → 1+5 = 6
- Result: 6‑vibration name (cooperative, caring, aesthetic, responsible)

## Interpreting Name Vibrations (1–9, 11, 22)

- 1: Initiative, independence, leadership, pioneering
- 2: Diplomacy, sensitivity, support, relationship‑first
- 3: Expression, creativity, social presence, optimism
- 4: Structure, reliability, discipline, long‑term building
- 5: Freedom, versatility, travel, marketing, rapid change
- 6: Care, service, beauty, harmony, guardianship
- 7: Depth, research, analysis, spiritual inquiry
- 8: Power, management, strategy, materialization
- 9: Compassion, global vision, publishing, teaching
- 11: Inspiration, intuition, higher ideals, originality
- 22: Master builder, systems, scalable impact, legacy

## Alignment: Name vs. Life Path

A powerful name complements—not replaces—your life path number. For example, a Life Path 7 benefits from names that support focus and credibility (4, 7, 8), while a Life Path 5 thrives with names that welcome change and visibility (3, 5, 9).

### Quick Harmony Matrix (Guiding Idea)
- Grounding: 4/8 with 1/4/8 life paths
- Expressive: 3/5/9 with 3/5/9 life paths
- Supportive: 2/6 with 2/6/9 life paths
- Insight‑oriented: 7/11 with 7/9/11 life paths

## Choosing or Adjusting a Name

- Consistency matters: public, professional, and digital use should match.
- Consider initials and nicknames—the vibration you use most tends to dominate.
- Test readability and memorability; numerology helps, but brand clarity wins in daily life.

## Timing: When a New Name “Locks In”

New vibrations stabilize through repetition. Practically, expect 3–6 months for people to adapt, and one personal year cycle to feel fully “lived in.”

## Ethical Notes

Numerology is a reflective tool—not a deterministic rule. Use it to clarify patterns, not to limit your choices.

## Try It Yourself

Pick a name you are considering. Calculate its number, compare it to your life path, and reflect on your current goals. If the resonance feels right—and the use is consistent—the name can become a steady signal that supports where you are headed.
